//The method arr.slice is much simpler than similar-looking arr.splice.

//The syntax is:

arr.slice([start], [end])

//It returns a new array copying to it all items from index start to end (not including end). Both start and end can be negative, in that case position from array end is assumed.
let arr = ["t", "e", "s", "t"];

alert( arr.slice(1, 3) ); // e,s (copy from 1 to 3)

alert( arr.slice(-2) ); // s,t (copy from -2 till the end)

//We can also call it without arguments: arr.slice() creates a copy of arr. That’s often used to obtain a copy for further transformations that should not affect the original array.
